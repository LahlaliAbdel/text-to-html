            <h1>Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers. In reality, web accessibility
                is a subset of User Experience (UX) focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people
                possible, including those who have disabilities.</h1>

            <p>Four categories of accessibility
                Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:
            </p>
            <section>
                <h1>visual
                    <p>This can be non-sighted users, users with low-visions, users with obstructed vision, or even
                        simply your aging parents.</p>
                </h1>

                <p>Associated conditions</p>
                <ul>Myopia</ul>
                <ul>Colour blindness</ul>
                <ul>Glaucoma</ul>
                <ul>Albinism</ul>
            </section>
            .


            <section>
                <h2>Auditory
                    <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be
                        considered for hearing impaired users.</p>
                </h2>

                <p>Associated conditions</p>
                <ul>Presbycusis</ul>
                <ul>Acoustic trauma</ul>
                <ul>Auditory processing disorder</ul>
                <ul>Otosclerosis</ul>
            </section>


            <section>
                <h3>Motor
                    <p>People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized
                        keyboards to eye trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a "switch") to navigate
                        their computers.</p>
                </h3>

                <p>Associated conditions</p>
                <ul>RSI</ul>
                <ul>Cerebral palsy</ul>
                <ul>Parkinson's</ul>
                <ul>Muscular dystrophy</ul>
            </section>


            <section>
                <h4>Cognitive
                    <p>Relates to the ease processing of information.</p>
                </h4>

                <p>Associated conditions</p>
                <ul>Down's syndrome</ul>
                <ul>Autism</ul>
                <ul>Global developmental delay</ul>
                <ul>Dyslexia</ul>
            </section>


            <section>Temporary disabilities
                <p>While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even
                    fully-abled people are “temporarily disabled”. For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily
                    prevent you from being able to use a mouse.</p>

                <p>Robin Christopherson (an accessibility expert who is blind) once spoke about how people that are
                    driving but use hands-free sets or have their phone connected to the car radio are temporarily
                    disabled, as they use the phone differently to how they normally would. Of course, no one should
                    browse websites while they are driving but it is important to understand different situations like
                    that, where the user may not have special software installed that a disabled user might.</p>
